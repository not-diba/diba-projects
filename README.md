# diba .projects

This is my personal project built in Astro. I mainly try to document my projects here in `crafts/`. As well as writing blogs in `writing/`.

## 🧱 Overview

This site has two main content sections:

- **🛠 `/craft`** – A showcase of my projects, experiments, and hands-on work.
- **📝 `/writing`** – A collection of blog posts and essays on different topics.
